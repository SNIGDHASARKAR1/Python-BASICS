        "Q1.  What is Python and why is it popular?\n",
        "     -  Python is a general purpose programming language that is used to build software and websites,automate tasks and analyze data.\n",
        "      Python is popular because of the following factors-\n",
        "      i.It is easy to learn ,\n",
        "      ii. It has an active, supportive community,\n",
        "      iii. It is flexible,\n",
        "      iv. It offers versatile web-developmental solutions,  \n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "    -   A Python interpreter is a program that reads and executes\n",
        "      python code line by line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "    -   Pre define keywords are used to define the syntax of the\n",
        "      coding. Keywords are- False, True, import, if, class, except, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Can keywords be used as variable name?\n",
        "     - No , keywords cannot be used as  variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "     - In Python, mutability refers to the ability to change the\n",
        "       value or state of an object after it has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Why are lists are mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "    -  Lists can be modified after creation whereas tuples once created cananot be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in\n",
        "    Python?      \n",
        "   -    The \"==\" operator is used to compare the values of two\n",
        "      objects.\n",
        "     It checks whether the values of the objects are equal.\n",
        "     The \"is\" operator is used to compare the identity of two objects. It checks whether the two variables point to the same object in memory. This operator is often used to check if a variable is None.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   -  Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional\n",
        "      statements. They are essential for controlling the flow of your program based on multiple conditions. Here are the three main logical operators in Python: and , or, not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is type casting in python?\n",
        "   - Type casting, also known as type conversion, is the process of\n",
        "     converting a variable from one data type to another. In Python, this can be done either implicitly or explicitly.\n",
        "     Eg- int(), str(), list(), etc\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type\n",
        "     casting?\n",
        "   - In implicit type conversion, Python automatically converts one\n",
        "     data type to another without any user intervention. This usually happens when performing operations involving mixed data types to prevent data loss.\n",
        "     Explicit type conversion requires the user to manually convert the data type using predefined functions like int(), float(), and str().\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "     - Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute code\n",
        "       based on certain conditions. The primary conditional statements are if, elif, and else.   \n",
        "Q12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "     - The elif (short for else if) statement allows us to check\n",
        "      multiple conditions.\n",
        "     eg-\n",
        "       a = 33\n",

        "\n",
        "Q13. What is the difference between for and while loop?\n",
        "    - for loop is used when you know the number of iterations in    advance or when iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).\n",
